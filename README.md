# Turtle Cross Street Game

Welcome to the Turtle Cross Street game, a Python-based interactive game designed to challenge users to help a turtle safely cross a street. The game is developed using the Python turtle module. The goal is to navigate the turtle from one side of the screen to the other while avoiding moving cars.

## Features

Dynamic Car Generation: Cars are generated at random intervals and move across the screen at varying speeds.
Player Progression: Each successful crossing increases the game's level and the speed of cars, making the game progressively more challenging.
Collision Detection: The game checks for collisions between the turtle and cars. A collision results in a game over.
Scoreboard: Displays the current level of the game and updates it upon the turtle successfully reaching the other side of the street. A "Game Over" message is displayed on collision.

## How to Play

Start Game: Run the script to start the game. The turtle will appear at the bottom of the screen.
Move Up: Press the "Up" arrow key to move the turtle forward.
Avoid Cars: Navigate through gaps in the traffic to reach the top of the screen.
Reach the Finish Line: Successfully guide the turtle to the top of the screen to complete a level and return to the starting position.
Each level increases the speed of the cars, so quick and careful movement is necessary to succeed.

## Requirements

To play the game, you need:

Python 3.x
turtle module (usually included with Python)
Additional game modules (player, car_manager, scoreboard), which should be in the same directory as the main game script.

## Installation
